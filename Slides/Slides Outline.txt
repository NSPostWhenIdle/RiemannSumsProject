Slides Outline

#Slide 0
Cover slide w/title 

#Slide 1
Overview - intro
	What we are going to talk about
		Riemann Sums
		Programming
		Math
		Regex (maybe)

#Slide 3
What is a Riemann Sum?
	Numerical method for integrating functions
	Upper sum and lower sum have to converge to use
	1/x from 0 to b is not Riemann integrable

Objectives
	What we set out to do
		#Slide 4
		##Motivations and inspirations
		Check Homework
		Similar to TI-83

		#Slide 5
		##Benefits of approach
		No internet required 
		No Wolfram required
		Able to work on Mobile well


Definitions of Riemann Sum
	Formulas for:
	#Each will be a slide with formula and illustration. 
		Left sum
		Right sum
		Middle sum
		Trapezoidal sum


	Incrementing by delta x causes floating point precision problems so incrementing
	Talk about which method is better in which situation

Stuff about the issues with the parsers
	operators and optimizations
